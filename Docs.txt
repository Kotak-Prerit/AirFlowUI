📖 AirflowUI Documentation

## Getting Started

### Introduction
Welcome to AirflowUI — your fastest path from idea to interface.
AirflowUI is a modern, free-to-use copy-paste component library built for developers who want to move fast without sacrificing design quality.

Instead of spending hours recreating the same buttons, cards, or navigation menus, you can simply browse through our library of 100+ components, copy the snippet, and paste it directly into your project.

We support multiple frameworks out of the box — HTML, Next.js, Vite.js, Astro, Vue.js, and Svelte — so whether you’re building a quick landing page or a production-ready SaaS dashboard, AirflowUI fits right into your stack.

Our components are inspired by the very best design sources: CodePen experiments, Dribbble shots, award-winning websites from Awwwards.com, and modern UI trends seen across the web. This means you’ll always be working with designs that feel fresh, aesthetic, and ready for today’s users.

### Design Principles

At AirflowUI, we follow a set of principles that guide everything we build:

1. Simplicity First → Copy, paste, and you’re done. Developers shouldn’t have to fight with complexity.
2. Modern by Default → Every component is inspired by leading design trends, animations, and micro-interactions.
3. Cross-Framework Support → Your code should work in HTML, React (Next.js/Vite), Vue, and Svelte without friction.
4. Customizable & Flexible → Built with TailwindCSS at the core, so you can easily adjust colors, spacing, and typography.
5. Accessibility Built-In → Components follow accessibility guidelines to ensure they work for all users.
6. Performance Minded → Components are lightweight, modular, and optimized for fast rendering.

### Usage Direction

Using AirflowUI is as simple as:

1. Browse Components → Pick the element you want (e.g., Button, Card, Modal, Navbar).
2. Choose Framework → Select from HTML, Next.js, Vite.js, Astro, Vue, or Svelte.
3. Copy the Snippet → Grab the ready-made code.
4. Paste & Run → Drop it into your project. Done.

Want to customize?
- Change Tailwind classes (colors, padding, borders) for quick tweaks.
- Add GSAP or Motion One for animations.
- Integrate Three.js if you want to add interactive 3D elements.

Example: Need a button? Copy it in your framework of choice and make it yours in seconds.

### Future Enhancements

AirflowUI starts simple — copy & paste today, smarter tomorrow. Our future roadmap includes:

- CLI Integration → Install components via `npx airflowui add button`.
- Smart Search → Find components with natural language (e.g., “dark mode pricing table”).
- User Dashboard → Bookmark components, organize collections, and share with your team.
- Full Templates → Not just components, but ready-to-deploy templates like landing pages, SaaS dashboards, and portfolios.
- Analytics → Discover trending components, most copied snippets, and community favorites.

We believe AirflowUI should not just save time — it should make building UIs enjoyable, fast, and beautiful.
